Reads an input file (Criminal.mf) and builds a tree structure with known criminal information.  Accepts user input and tippers, builds the tree further and appends the input file with the new information.  Allows the user to conduct an inquiry on the currently stored criminal information using a binary tree search algorithm, and eliminates suspects that do not match known tippers.
